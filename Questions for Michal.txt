user.routers.js ln 30. 		.then(() => res.status(201).json(User))       // This seems dangerous. yet it is what is discribed for testing purposes. 

SIDELINED - Login with bad data causes crash rather than offering to send to create user screen
FIXED - settings.js doesn't seem to be saving settings data
	user.router.js ln 53 proves data is received by the server. 
	looking at Robo 3T shows us that the data has been updated
	settings.js ln 120 success redirects us back to index.html
	calls protected.js ln 24 shows that settings are not received from the server 
	user.router.js ln 41 returns req.user on a successful get request. 
	This only seems to happen until you log out and relog at which point the app can find your settings
SKIPPED - testing getting a range of shifts returning unauthorized
FIXED - sign up doesn't log you in.

- index.html   " under by $-0.44239999999999924. " Should be limited to 2 decimal places
- graphs.html   display dates in an easy to read way, 
- graphs.html   display data sorted by date
- input paycheck.html   "enter how MUCH taxes were"
input paycheck.html   on enter does nothing		?????
- input shift   needs confirmation before sending
input shift   should have a way to easly see what days you have already entered.
